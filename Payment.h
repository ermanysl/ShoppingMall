*        basic functions related with abstract Payment class.
*        There will be no .cpp file for Payment class since setter & getter
*        functions are implemented as inline functions at this header and the other
*        function of this class is a virtual function which will be implemented
*        at derived classes. So there is no need to include a .cpp file for Payment class
